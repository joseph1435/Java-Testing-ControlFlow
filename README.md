# Java-Testing-ControlFlow

This is a simple Java project that demonstrates how nested `if-else` statements work and how control flow affects the output of a program.

## Description

The program evaluates a variable `aNumber` and prints specific output based on its value. It helps illustrate common pitfalls in Java control structures, especially indentation and missing braces.

## Files Included

- `Test.java` – Main file with the nested if-else logic
- `Test.class` – Compiled Java bytecode
- `hs_err_pid*.log` – Error logs (auto-generated by Java)

## How to Run

1. Open the folder in VS Code or your terminal.
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac Test.java
